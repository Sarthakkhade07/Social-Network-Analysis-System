# Social-Network-Analysis-System
DSA Project (Graphs- BFS)
Developed a scalable graph-based social network analyzer using C++ and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute shortest user connection paths and mutual friends. Implemented optimized adjacency lists and hash-based user mapping to support 100,000+ users with O(V + E) performance, simulating real-world platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook.
